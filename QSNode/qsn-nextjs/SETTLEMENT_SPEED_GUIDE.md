# 🚀 Settlement Speed - Complete Guide

## ✅ Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL

The settlement speed gauge on your dashboard is now displaying **REAL blockchain data** with live updates as blocks are mined.

---

## 📊 What You're Seeing

### Settlement Speed Card Display
Located on the main dashboard, the card shows:
- **Main Value**: The median settlement speed in seconds (e.g., 1.00s)
- **Progress Circle**: Visual gauge showing speed performance
- **Block Number**: Current block being measured
- **Sample Count**: Number of blocks analyzed for the median (up to 50)
- **Status**: Color-coded indicator (🟢 Green if <1s, 🟡 Yellow if >1s)

---

## 🔄 How Real-Time Updates Work

### 1. **Automatic Polling**
- Dashboard fetches settlement speed every **2 seconds**
- Updates the gauge value smoothly with CSS transitions
- Shows the most current block number

### 2. **Backend Calculation**
- API tracks the last 50 blocks in memory
- Calculates **median time between blocks**
- Returns real finality latency

### 3. **On-Chain Measurement**
- Data comes directly from blockchain block timestamps
- No simulation or mocking
- Real, verifiable metrics

## 🎯 Testing Settlement Speed Live

### Option 1: Automatic Test Transactions

Use the test mining endpoint to generate blocks:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/test-mining \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"count": 5}'
```

**Response**: Generates 5 transactions, each creating a new block. Settlement speed will update as blocks are mined.

### Option 2: Manual Transfers

Send your own transactions from your wallet to trigger block mining.

### Option 3: Watch Historical Data

The gauge always shows historical settlement speed data from previously mined blocks - no action needed!

## 📡 API Endpoints

### Get Real Settlement Speed
```bash
GET http://localhost:3000/api/metrics/settlement-speed
```

**Response Example**:
```json
{
  "real": true,
  "settlementSpeed": 1.00,
  "median": true,
  "unit": "seconds",
  "blockNumber": 75,
  "blockTimestamp": "2025-10-23T03:44:38.000Z",
  "sampledBlocks": 50,
  "blockTimes": [6217, 7616, 8106, 11948, 43740],
  "avgTransactionsPerBlock": 1.0,
  "totalTransactionsTracked": 50,
  "networkId": 31337,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-23T03:44:45.123Z"
}
```

### Generate Test Transactions
```bash
POST http://localhost:3000/api/test-mining
Body: {"count": 5}
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Settlement Speed Not Updating?

**Problem**: Gauge shows same value, block number unchanged
**Cause**: No new blocks are being mined
**Solution**: 
1. Generate transactions using `/api/test-mining` endpoint
2. Or manually transfer tokens to trigger block mining
3. Hardhat only mines blocks when transactions occur (lazy mining)

### Errors in Browser Console?

**Check**:
1. Is the Next.js dev server running on port 3000?
2. Is the Hardhat node running on port 8545?
3. Check browser console (F12) for specific errors

### Settlement Speed Seems Wrong?

**Note**: Hardhat's lazy mining means blocks may be mined very quickly when multiple transactions are pending, resulting in:
- Very fast settlement speeds (< 0.1s between blocks)
- Variable speeds depending on transaction patterns
- This is **normal behavior** for lazy-mining

## 🎬 Live Demo

1. **Open Dashboard**: http://localhost:3000
2. **Watch Settlement Speed Gauge**: Observe the current value and block number
3. **Generate Blocks**: 
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/test-mining -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"count": 5}'
   ```
4. **Watch Updates**: The gauge will update as new blocks are mined
5. **Refresh Settlement Speed**: Poll the API every 2 seconds
   ```bash
   watch -n 2 'curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/metrics/settlement-speed | jq'
   ```

## 📈 Metrics Explained

### Settlement Speed
- **Definition**: Median time between consecutive blocks
- **Unit**: Seconds
- **Range**: 0.1s to 5.0s (clamped for visualization)
- **Calculation**: Sorted block times, middle value taken

### Sampled Blocks
- **Definition**: Number of blocks used for median calculation
- **Range**: 1 to 50 (tracks last 50 blocks)
- **Importance**: More samples = more accurate median

### Block Times
- **Definition**: Array of time differences between consecutive blocks
- **Shows**: Last 5 intervals (in seconds)
- **Use**: Visual confirmation of consistency

### Average Transactions Per Block
- **Definition**: Mean number of transactions per tracked block
- **Shows**: Network activity level

### Total Transactions Tracked
- **Definition**: Sum of all transactions in the last 50 blocks
- **Use**: Network throughput indicator

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
RPC_URL=http://localhost:8545  # Default: connects to local Hardhat node
```

### API Route
- **Endpoint**: `http://localhost:3000/api/metrics/settlement-speed`
- **Method**: GET (no body required)
- **Rate Limit**: None (unlimited calls)
- **Cache**: No (fresh data each call)

---

## 🔐 Production Considerations

For production deployment:

1. **Persistent State**: Replace in-memory block history with database
   - Redis for caching
   - PostgreSQL for historical data

2. **Scalability**:
   - Use a managed RPC provider (Alchemy, Infura)
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add response caching

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Track API response times
   - Monitor blockchain connectivity
   - Alert on settlement speed anomalies

4. **Accuracy**:
   - Validate block timestamps on-chain
   - Handle blockchain reorganizations
   - Cross-check with block explorers

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

### Monitor Real-Time Updates
```bash
watch -n 1 'curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/metrics/settlement-speed | jq "{speed: .settlementSpeed, block: .blockNumber, blocks: .sampledBlocks}"'
```

### Generate Multiple Blocks Quickly
```bash
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/test-mining -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"count": 2}' &
  sleep 0.5
done
wait
```

### Check Blockchain Height
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/metrics/settlement-speed | jq '.blockNumber'
```

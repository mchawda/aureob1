## üèóÔ∏è Smart Contract Architecture

### ComplianceGate Contract Functions

```solidity
// Check if a transaction is allowed
function isAllowed(
    address sender,
    address recipient,
    uint256 amount
) public view returns (bool)

// Admin functions (regulator access)
function setAllowlist(address account, bool allowed) external onlyAdmin
function setBlocklist(address account, bool blocked) external onlyAdmin
```

### FiatToken Integration

Every `mint()`, `burn()`, and `transfer()` call in the FiatToken contract **MUST** pass through ComplianceGate:

```solidity
// Before every transaction
require(
    complianceGate.isAllowed(sender, recipient, amount),
    "ComplianceGate: Transaction not allowed"
);
```

**This is blockchain-enforced compliance - no software can bypass it.**
